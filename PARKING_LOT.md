# Parking lot — ideas go here, never to code

Rule: nothing below starts until the current loop is fun-verified by the owner.
Append freely; promoting an item requires updating the scope contract in CLAUDE.md first.

## Parked from Kethral (proven-built once, deliberately not rebuilt yet)

- Procedural dungeon generation
- Branching dialogue / NPC trust / factions
- Status effects, crafting, charms, bestiary, codex
- Weather + time-of-day systems, NPC schedules
- Quests, shops, inventory, hotbar
- Multiple weapons / damage triangle
- Local co-op
- MIDI engine / procedural SFX (dropped by owner order — do not revive)

## New ideas (this project)

- YJIT via self-built Ruby (only if profiling ever shows frame drops)

## World mythology (docs-only — no code until fun-verify, then only via scope-contract update)

- `docs/lore/world-bible.md` — standalone Egyptian×Fantasy world bible (Tibia-method: original
  pantheon, every creature family traced to the mythology, gods withdrawn but omnipresent).
  Deliberately NOT bound to Kethral names (owner call 2026-08-09) — integration is a future
  decision. Research canon behind it: 4 `game-research/` vault notes (egyptian-cosmology,
  egyptian-death-afterlife, akhenaten-amarna, new-kingdom-power — query via
  `hub kb query --domain game-research`). Its gameplay-hooks appendix maps lore → parked
  systems (corpse-run, respawn, skill-through-use, factions, bestiary). Unblocks the
  "fiction-bound audio/visual identity pass" below.

## Queued from the feature map (drafts/_kethral-feature-map.md) — next candidates post fun-verify

- Corpse-run gear drop (kethral's signature death tension — top candidate)
- Third zone tier (Vonash) + BSP-generated dungeon layouts (fixed seed, learnable geography)
- Room names on first visit ("The Entry Wound" style — cheap atmosphere)
- Stamina economy, loot drops, skill-through-use progression

## A1+ queue (cut from Increment A by the 2026-08-09 dual review — each behind its own fun-verify)

- A1: gambit engine (JSON IF/THEN ally rules) + dev hot-reload keybind for iteration
  - ~~Adjacent-lobber inertness~~ CLOSED in M2.1 (owner verdict "teammates feel dumb"
    promoted the minimal fix): husk-grade retreat_step in AiController — adjacent
    projectile kit steps away to open range, then fires. FULL kiting/retreat behavior
    (hold range while repositioning, flee at low HP) remains gambit territory here.
- A1+: Shooters (ranged humans — needs per-attacker cadence proven first)
- A2: pull economy with aggro soft-cap (8-12) + density costs (review: without the cap it is
  monotonically exploitable)
- A3: nest advance / district progression (break districts, re-home the nest)
- Fiction-bound audio/visual identity pass (waits on the bible)
